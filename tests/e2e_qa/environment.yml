# Conda Environment for E2E QA Examples
# 
# This file defines the conda environment for running the anaconda-opentelemetry
# E2E QA demonstration examples.
#
# Usage:
#   conda env create -f environment.yml
#   conda activate e2e-qa-examples
#
# To update an existing environment:
#   conda env update -f environment.yml --prune

name: e2e-qa-examples

dependencies:
  # Python version (3.10 recommended, 3.9+ required)
  - python=3.10
  
  # Required dependencies
  - pip
  
  # Install the anaconda-opentelemetry SDK and its dependencies
  - pip:
    # Additional dependencies for E2E examples (not part of SDK)
    - python-dotenv>=1.0.0
    
    # Install the SDK - choose ONE of the following options:
    
    # OPTION 1: Development version (local code) - DEFAULT for pre-release testing
    - -e ../../
    
    # OPTION 2: Specific published version - uncomment when testing a published release
    # - anaconda-opentelemetry==1.0.0
    
    # OPTION 3: Latest published version - uncomment to test with latest release
    # - anaconda-opentelemetry

# Notes:
# SDK Version Selection:
# - Development testing (DEFAULT): Use "-e ../../" to test local changes (current: v1.0.0)
# - Release testing: Use "anaconda-opentelemetry==X.Y.Z" to test a specific published version
# - Latest testing: Use "anaconda-opentelemetry" (no version) to test the latest published version
# 
# The SDK automatically installs its dependencies (opentelemetry-api==1.38.0, opentelemetry-sdk==1.38.0, etc.)
# as defined in the SDK's pyproject.toml. This setup mimics how external products would use the SDK.
# 
# Note: Until anaconda-opentelemetry is published to PyPI, use the development version (-e ../../)
